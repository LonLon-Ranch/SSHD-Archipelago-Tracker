                        The <b>Options</b> screen is the landing page of the
                        tracker. Here you can configure your run so that the
                        tracker knows which Randomizer version you are using,
                        which logical rules apply, and which settings you've
                        chosen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <b>Releases</b> dropdown allows you to choose your
                        Randomizer version. The Randomizer window will typically
                        include a version number, which is the version that you
                        need to select in the dropdown. Participants in racing
                        matches may instead be using a special "Racing Build",
                        which can also be selected in this dropdown.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are testing a special beta features build, the{' '}
                        <b>Beta Feature</b> tab may instead be used. Ask the
                        provider of this build for instructions on setting up
                        the tracker.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After you selected the correct Randomizer release, you
                        can paste the <b>Settings String</b> that you acquired
                        from the Randomizer. This will transfer all settings
                        from the randomizer{' '}
                        <i>
                            as long as you selected the correct Randomizer
                            release
                        </i>
                        . Settings strings are version-specific, a settings
                        string from a different Randomizer version will result
                        in wrong settings and starting items.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As an alternative to the settings string, you can also
                        save and load <b>Presets</b> using the button of the
                        same name. In addition to any presets created by you in
                        the Tracker application, official Randomizer presets are
                        offered. For example, an official Racing release may
                        include an official Racing preset.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You should not need to change the <b>Settings</b> below
                        much — after all, you already should have the correct
                        settings due to the settings string or preset. You can
                        however inspect the settings for correctness or change
                        settings for experimentation purposes. The tracker
                        supports all options listed there, but only logically
                        relevant options are included — cosmetic options are
                        excluded, for example.

                        on your capture window(s) in order to capture the

                        The <b>Dungeon Tracker</b> allows you to mark dungeons

                        dungeon, and allows you to track some dungeon-related
                        items. The game's six main dungeons along with their
                        abbreviations are:

                        Additionally, Sky Keep (SK) can appear in the dungeon
                        tracker if your settings may require you to visit Sky
                        Keep or at least enter the Sky Keep Entrance in Skyloft,
                        but Sky Keep cannot be required like the other dungeons.

                        dungeon in the Location Tracker. A dungeon label will
                        have a strikethrough visualization if you marked the
                        dungeon's "completion check" as acquired; this is what
                        the Randomizer checks for when deciding whether to open
                        the door to Hylia's Realm and thus the Randomizer's end
                        game.

                        The location tracker allows you to mark locations (or
                        "checks") as acquired, displays each location's logical
                        state given your currently marked items, and shows item
                        requirements for access to each check.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Locations are grouped by their <b>Hint Region</b>. The{' '}
                        <b>Map Layout</b> displays regions on a map, while the{' '}
                        <b>List Layout</b> arranges all regions in a flat list.
                        We recommend the map layout, but the legacy list layout
                        can be enabled in the customization menu.

                    <p>
                        Note that only logically relevant locations are
                        displayed — locations excluded by current settings are
                        hidden. If <b>Empty Unrequired Dungeons</b> is enabled
                        and you haven't marked any dungeons as required, those
                        dungeons won't display any checks, so make sure to mark
                        your required dungeons.

                    <p>
                        Locations will be displayed in different colors
                        depending on the logical state (note that colors can be
                        customized; these are default colors):

                    <p>
                        Note that you might be able to access some locations
                        even if the tracker shows them as Out of Logic. This can
                        have technical reasons or balance reasons — the
                        randomizer's logic framework has limits regarding the
                        kinds of logic that can be expressed, so dungeon key
                        logic may be overly pessimistic. Other locations can be
                        reached with tricks that the randomizer does not enable
                        by default so as to make seeds not overly difficult for
                        players.

                        Hovering over a location shows a{' '}
                        <b>Requirements Tooltip</b> that shows exact
                        prerequisites for the location's access logic in form of
                        a boolean expression. Prerequisites can be items, wallet
                        capacity, gratitude crystals, tricks and goddess cubes.
                        These requirements are dynamically computed from the
                        world graph, so a location may show{' '}

                        access to this location; this is typically due to an
                        entrance you haven't tracked. Marking additional

                        unmarks it. Right-clicking on the region marker (map
                        layout only) or the region name opens a context menu
                        where you can mark all locations (or all locations in

                        The locations list may include regular checks (can

                        (contain a single gratitude crystal), Gossip Stones (may
                        contain a hint), and goddess cubes (unlock a goddess
                        chest in the Sky). Only regular checks count towards
                        counters. Loose gratitude crystals are shown for marking
                        even if logically excluded, but the fact that they are
                        logically excluded will be highlighted.

                        can be added the same way. Alternatively, you can drag
                        and drop a dungeon label to assign a path hint, and drag
                        and drop an item to assign an imprecise item hint.

                    <p>
                        <b>Location hints</b> (location X has item Y) can be
                        assigned by right-clicking a location and choosing the
                        item. Alternatively, you can drag and drop an item onto
                        a location to mark the location as containing that item.

                        Dragging and item and dropping it onto the location you
                        found it in can be useful for tracking whether you found
                        the the location an SOTS hint, an imprecise item hint or
                        a path hint might have referred to.

                        The customization option{' '}
                        <b>Assign items to locations while tracking</b> allows
                        you to automatically record that a collected check held
                        a particular item. To do this, you need to first mark a
                        location and then click the item you found there.
